        Once upon a time, there was a {{adjectives.get()}} kingdom filled with {{nouns.get()}}.
        This land was called {{adjectives.get()}}-land. This land and its {{nouns.get()}}
        were having a {{adjectives.get()}}, where everyone lived {{adjectives.get()}} lives
        and spent their days {{adverbs.get()}} {{verbs.get()}}. However, all was not {{adjectives.get()}}
        in the kingdom, for there was a {{adjectives.get()}} {{nouns.get()}} that tried to {{verbs.get()}}
        the subjects. Following this {{adjectives.get()}} situation, all of the people in the land
        brought together their {{nouns.get()}} in order to {{verbs.get()}} the {{adjectives.get()}} being.

        After a significant number of {{nouns.get()}} lost, the kingdom gathered together to {{verbs.get()}}
        their citizens and declare victory. All was now {{adjectives.get()}}, and they all {{verbs.get()}}
        {{adverbs.get()}} ever after.

        The end.
